	<p>Discover the magic of Cape Kidnappers – the ocean, the majestic cliffs and the glorious gannets.  Join our experienced guides and visit the largest mainland gannet colony in the world!</p>
	<p>Our tour operates in an outdoor environment that is always changing, where there are inherent risks and where conditions can change quickly.  The tour route can be subject to unpredictable slips, rockfalls, rough and rugged terrain and other naturally occurring hazards.  The recent QRA report (jointly commissioned by Hastings District Council and Dept. of Conservation) states the safest way to experience the beach route to Cape Kidnappers is with our organised tour to ‘take advantage of local knowledge and reduced exposure time’.</p>

	<p>Come on a unique, fun eco-experience tour, in sunny Hawke’s Bay. Our tour is suitable for all ages and fitness levels, with personalized service and guides who point out the natural and geological wonders of the area.</p>
	<p>Our tour provides a 4-hour mild adventure, travelling along the majestically rugged coastline from Clifton to Cape Kidnappers and we are proud to have safely transported passengers and helped them enjoy this amazing area for over 69 years.</p>
	<IMG SRC="img/download.jfif" ALIGN="Top" CLASS = "textwrap2">
	<p>During the tour you will: </p>
	<li>
		<ul>Spend time with and get incredibly close to the majestic gannets in their natural habitat;</ul>
		<ul>Discover how nature has shaped and formed the towering cliffs of the Cape Kidnappers coastline;</ul>
		<ul>View ancient earthquake fault lines & fossils, and see gullies formed by wind and water;</ul>
		<ul>Enjoy a memorable tour experience while travelling on our iconic vintage tractors.</ul>
	</li>
	<p>A ride with Gannet Beach Adventures can be many things – a nice day beside the sea, an opportunity to view the amazing wildlife, or a trip back in time as told by the layers in the coastal cliffs. Put them all together and it is a really special experience – come and see for yourself!</p>
	<p>The adult gannets are all back in full-force by the time we open each September. The chicks start appearing from mid to late November, and they will leave the colonies at around 15-16 weeks of age. As the adults start to leave once their chick has fledged, bird numbers do get low during the latter part of our season (late March/April).</p>
